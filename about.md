# About

I studied electrical engineering (and other stuff) at [Virginia Tech](http://vt.edu) and graduated fairly recently.
I'm currently employed as a software engineer working on embedded systems.

I think that the articles on this site will mostly be technical (that's just where I am right now in my life).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:alxlit@alxlit.name).

You can find me on
[GitHub](http://github.com/alxlit),
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/alxlit), and 
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/alxlit).

You can also subscribe to the [RSS](/feed.xml) feed.
